# CMPUT 654: Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning F2023


Following Tong Zhang's [book](https://tongzhang-ml.org/lt-book/lt-book.pdf), students will be introduced to the basic tools required to understand foundational results in learning theory and will get them prepared to read and understand a large portion of learning theory papers. The focus is on the the statistical approach to learning: The contents of the first 12 chapters from Tong Zhang's book.


## Pre-requisites

Students are expected to follow (and even enjoy) mathematical proofs, deal with expressions involving probabilities and have a working knowledge of calculus and linear algebra. 

Basic probability, linear algebra and convex optimization is covered in Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7, 26, and 38 of the [Bandit Algorithms book](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf). One very nice book that covers more, but is still highly recommended is [A Second Course in Probability Theory](http://people.bu.edu/pekoz/A_Second_Course_in_Probability-Ross-Pekoz.pdf). The book is available online and also in book format. Chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5 are most useful from here.


## Instructor
- [Csaba Szepesv&aacute;ri](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva)  

## Lecture Time
Monday and Wednesdays from 3:30 PM - 4:50 PM (MST) in T 1-100.

### Office Hours
We use slack for discussion of short questions. If more time is needed, arrange it with the instructor using slack.

<!-- ## Grading

The students will be graded on four problem sheets (with one warm-up sheet), worth 10% of the grade each, and a midterm worth 20%. The problem sheets and mid-term ought to take around 12 hours each to complete to a good standard. The remaining 40% of the grade will be awarded based on the quality of the final project. The students will likely need to spend at least 10 hours each week reading, thinking and writing in order to produce a good project.

<!-- ## eClass
We will use eclass for assignment submissions. The link to join eClass can be found [here](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/course/view.php?id=76687).
We will not use eClass for announcements and discussions. For these we will use Slack. -->

## Slack Channel
We will use Slack for everything.
We have a separate workspace to discuss all topics related for this course. 
<!-- This channel is open to anyone who is on Amii slack. -->
If you would like to join the channel please message the instructor.
<!-- For discussions related to marking, assignment schedule, etc. we have a second channel `#cmput653-private-discussion-w2022`, which is by invitation only. -->
<!-- The TAs will add anyone who is taking the course for credit to these slack channels. -->
All announcements will be made on this channel.
We strongly encourage all students to ask questions regarding course content on the Slack channel.

<!-- ## Google Meet Information
The google meet information will be posted on the slack channel and on eClass.
This is relevant up to the point when teaching becomes in-person. -->

<!-- ## Grading Policies
Can be found on [eClass](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/course/view.php?id=76687). -->

## Lectures Notes
The lecture notes for this year's class are under the heading **LECTURE NOTES**.


<!-- ## Flipped Class
For the first three weeks, as mentioned above, we will follow a flipped class format:
Students coming to class are required to
- read the associated lecture notes and/or watch the lecture recordings
- prepare and vote on questions on the slack discussion channel

In class time will be spent on a
- quick review of the material
- discussing the most voted questions
- small group discussions of various topics -->

**Keywords:** Theory, Machine learning, Statistical learning, Concentration inequalities, Uniform deviation bounds
