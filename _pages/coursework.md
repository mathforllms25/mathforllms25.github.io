### Coursework and Grading

This is a research-focused seminar. Evaluation is based on your active engagement with the material, your presentation of a core research paper, and a final research project.

#### Grading Breakdown

  * **Paper Presentation (40%):** In pairs, students will prepare and deliver a presentation on an assigned research paper, followed by leading a class discussion.
  * **Final Project (50%):** A substantial research-oriented project. This includes a final presentation to the class and a written report.
  * **Participation (10%):** Active and thoughtful participation in class discussions is expected.

#### Course Structure and Managing a Large Seminar

With 20 students, we will adopt the following structure to ensure everyone has a chance to participate fully:

  * **Paper Presentations:** Students will present in pairs. This results in 10 presentation slots, which will form the core of the second half of the course. Each pair will be responsible for becoming the class "expert" on their assigned paper, presenting its core ideas, and facilitating a critical discussion.

  * **Final Project Presentations:** The last two and a half weeks of the semester are dedicated to final project presentations. To accommodate all students, we will use all scheduled class times. If necessary, an additional session may be scheduled during the final examination period.
